## 20230601 version 0.7.0 major update

Finished most of the main parts.
Search function has been implemented.

### What is needed:

1. Main video on playing, if there is an error video, it won't play the video. I have already implemented a function to avoid this on card modal player but didn't have enough time to modify & apply for main video.
2. There zero work on media query. Much work to do for the mobile friendly website.
3. The codes need to be cleaned big time! + need to modulize codes for a better read quality.
4. Could be nice to implement full screen support for the video.
5. Could be very nice to ask users to allow downloading more data for a better movie/tv search. At the moment download pages for movie is 50.
